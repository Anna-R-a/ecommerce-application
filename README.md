## Description of Our Project

Our project is an online store of farm products.\
The store gives an opportunity to register a new user, choose healthy GMO-free products from farmers and put them in the shopping cart.\
Since a healthy lifestyle is now an integral part of modern people, farm products are in great demand.

## The Technology Stack
The front-end: HTML5, CSS 3, TypeScript, React 18.2.
The back-end: commercetools.com

## Getting Started with App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone our project with the command `git clone  https://github.com/Anna-R-a/ecommerce-application.git`
Go to the *ecommerce-application folder* by executing `cd ecommerce-application`
Install all dependencies by running `npm i`
Start running the build by executing `npm run start`
The browser bar will display the localhost:3000 main page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.


### `npm run format`

Automatically formats and fixes code in your project


### `npm run lint`

Statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems


### `npm run prepare`

 Initialize Husky to manage Git hooks, automating tasks such as code formatting and linting checks during the commit process
